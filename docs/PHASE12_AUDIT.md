### What Changed
- Added `docs/THEME_AUDIT.md` comprehensive theme audit
- Documented color system for both themes
- Page-by-page visual audit

- WCAG contrast ratio analysis

### Audit Results
| Category | Items | Pass | Issues |
|----------|-------|------|--------|
| Pages | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| Components | 4 | 4 | 0 |

- [x] All text uses theme-aware colors
- [x] Frame/card borders respond to theme

- [x] Dynamic theme switching works

### Screenshots
- Screenshots showing dark vs light for each page pending

### Human-Experience Checklist
